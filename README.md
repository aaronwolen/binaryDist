# binaryDist

This package provides a function for efficiently calculating the binary distance of a matrix. It's a fork of [@NikNakk](http://github.com/NikNakk)'s original [binaryDist](http://github.com/NikNakk/binaryDist) repository. He did all the hard stuff. I basically just turned it into an installable package.
